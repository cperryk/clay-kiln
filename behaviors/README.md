# checkbox-group

A group of checkboxes, allowing the user to toggle on or off related items.

## Arguments

* **options** _(required)_ an array of checkboxes

Each option should be an object with `name` and `value` properties. Use the bootstrap to specify which should be toggled by default, e.g.

```yaml
field1:
  option1: true
  option2: false
  option3: false
```

# checkbox

A single checkbox, allowing the user to toggle something on or off.

## Arguments

* **label** _(required)_ the checkbox label

In practice, it's usually best to use a conversational tone / question as the checkbox label, with the field label being shorter. e.g.

```yaml
field1:
  _label: Special Logo
  _has:
    fn: checkbox
    label: Should we use a special logo in this component?
```

# codemirror

A syntax-highlighted text area. Useful for writing css, sass, yaml, or other code in the editor.

## Arguments

* **mode** _(required)_ the language used

The mode of the editor sets syntax highlighting, linting, and other functionality. Currently, we support these modes:

* `text/css` - css mode
* `text/x-scss` - sass/scss mode (useful for per-instance styles)
* `text/x-yaml` - yaml mode (useful for writing elasticsearch queries)

_Note:_ We will add more supported modes as we find use cases for them. See [this link](http://codemirror.net/mode/) for the full list of modes supported in codemirror.

# description

Appends a description to a field.

## Arguments

* **value** _(required)_ field description, allows html

# label

Appends a label to a field. This is pulled from the field's `_label` property, and falls back to using the key of the field.

## Arguments

_No arguments_

# lock

Append a lock button to an input. The input will be locked until the user clicks the lock button. This provides a small amount of friction before editing important (and rarely-edited) fields, similar to macOS's system preferences.

# magic-button

Append a magic button to an input.

## Arguments

* **field** _(optional)_ a field to grab the value from
* **component** _(optional)_ a name of a component to grab the component ref from
* **transform** _(optional)_ a transform to apply to the grabbed value
* **transformArg** _(optional)_ an argument to pass through to the transform
* **store** _(optional)_ to grab data from the client-side store
* **url** _(optional)_ to get data from
* **property** _(optional)_ to get from the returned data
* **moreMagic** _(optional)_ to run the returned value through more transforms, api calls, etc

☆.。.:*・°☆.。.:*・°☆.。.:*・°☆.。.:*・°☆

Magic buttons are extremely powerful, but can be a little confusing to configure. This is what they generally look like:

1. specify a `field` or `component`. The button will grab the value or ref, respectively
2. specify a `transform`. Transforms are useful when doing api calls with that data
2. specify a `transformArg` if you need to send more information to the transform.
3. specify a `store` path or `url` if you need to grab data from somewhere. The request will be prefixed with the `store`/`url` string you pass in.
4. specify a `property` to grab from the result of that api call. You can use `_.get()` syntax, e.g. `foo.bar[0].baz`
5. add `moreMagic` if you need to do anything else to the returned data

**All of these arguments are optional!**

## Here are some examples:

_Note: MediaPlay is the name of our image server._

### (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ "just grab the primary headline"

```yaml
field: primaryHeadline
```

### (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ "grab a caption from mediaplay"

```yaml
field: url
transform: mediaplayUrl (to change the image url into a string we can query mediaplay's api with)
url: [mediaplay api url]
property: metadata.caption
```

### (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ "grab the url of the first mediaplay-image on this page"

```yaml
component: mediaplay-image
store: components
property: url
```

### (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ "grab a list of items keyed by some component uri"

```yaml
component: mediaplay-image
transform: getComponentInstance (this transforms the full component uri into a ref we can pop onto the end of our site prefix)
url: $SITE_PREFIX/lists/images (this is a ~ special token ~ that evaluates to the prefix of current site, so you can do api calls against your own clay instance)
```

### (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ "grab the image url from a lede component, then ask mediaplay for the caption"

```yaml
component: feature-lede
store: components
property: imgUrl
moreMagic:
  -
    transform: mediaplayUrl (to change the image url into a string we can query mediaplay's api with)
    url: [mediaplay api url]
    property: metadata.caption
```

### (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ "grab the tv show name and use it to automatically format an image url"

```yaml
field: showName
transform: formatUrl
transformArg: [base image url]/recaps-$DATAFIELD.png ($DATAFIELD is the placeholder in our formatUrl transform)
```

# radio

A group of radio buttons, allowing the user to select one of a few related options.

## Arguments

* **options** _(required)_ an array of strings

Unlike [checkbox-group](https://github.com/nymag/clay-kiln/blob/master/behaviors/checkbox-group.md), each option should be a string rather than an object. The label for each option will simply be the option converted to Start Case.

```yaml
field1:
  _has:
    fn: radio
    options:
      - foo # looks like Foo
      - bar # looks like Bar
      - baz # looks like Baz
```

# required

Appends "required" to a field's label, to mark that field as required.

## Arguments

_No arguments_

# segmented-button

A group of buttons allowing the user to select one of a few related options. Functions like a styled radio button.

## Arguments

* **options** _(required)_ an array of options

Each option should be an object with `icon`, `text`, and `value` properties. If `icon`s are provided the buttons will use those rather than the text.

_Note:_ It's best to choose either icons or text for all segments of the button, rather than interspersing them.

# segmented-button-group

A group of segmented buttons allowing the user to select one of a few related options. Functions like styled radio buttons.

## Arguments

* **options** _(required)_ an array of options

Each option should be an object with `title` and `values` properties. The `values` should be an array of objects with `icon`, `text`, and `value` properties. Like `segmented-button`, if `icon`s are provided the buttons will use those rather than the text.

_Note:_ It's best to choose either icons or text for all segments of the button, rather than interspersing them.

# select

A standard browser `<select>` element, allowing the user to select one of a few related options.

_Notes:_

- the first item in `options` is pre-selected
- you can force the user to select an option by adding a `required` behavior and by setting the options like this:

```yaml
    fn: select
    options:
      -
      - foo
      - bar
```

Since a blank option is selected by default, the validator will fail.

## Arguments

* **options** _(required)_ an array of strings

Unlike [checkbox-group](https://github.com/nymag/clay-kiln/blob/master/behaviors/checkbox-group.md), each option should be a string rather than an object. The label for each option will simply be the option converted to Start Case.

```yaml
field1:
  _has:
    fn: select
    options:
      - foo # looks like Foo
      - bar # looks like Bar
      - baz # looks like Baz
```

# site-specific-select

A standard browser `<select>` element, allowing the user to select one of a few related options. Options are delineated by site, using the site slug.

## Arguments

* **sites** _(required)_ an array of site options
* **default** _(optional)_ an array of default options

Each site should have a `slug` to match and an `options` array. Similar to the [select behavior](https://github.com/nymag/clay-kiln/blob/master/behaviors/select.md), options are an array of strings. The label for each option will simply be the option converted to Start Case.

```yaml
field1:
  _has:
    fn: site-specific-select
    sites:
      -
        slug: site1
        options:
          - foo # looks like Foo
          - bar # looks like Bar
          - baz # looks like Baz
      -
        slug: site2
        options:
          - quz
          - quuz
```

You may also specify `default` options that will be used if no site slug matches.

```yaml
field1:
  _has:
    fn: site-specific-select
    sites:
      -
        slug: site1
        options:
          - foo # looks like Foo
          - bar # looks like Bar
          - baz # looks like Baz
    default:
      - quz
      - quuz
```

# soft-maxlength

Appends a character count to an input. Allows the user to type above the limit, but can be paired with publishing validation to prevent publishing things that are too long.

## Arguments

* **value** _(required)_ number of characters that should be allowed

The character count will update as users type into the input, and will turn red if they type more characters than allowed.

# text

A one-line text input.

## Arguments

* **type** _(optional)_ defaults to `text` if not defined
* **required** _(optional)_ set input required (blocking)
* **pattern** _(optional)_ required input pattern (blocking)
* **minLength** _(optional)_ minimum number of characters required (blocking)
* **maxLength** _(optional)_ maximum number of characters allowed (blocking)
* **placeholder** _(optional)_ placeholder that will display in the input
* **autocomplete** _(optional)_ enable/disable autocomplete on field (defaults to true)
* **step** _(optional)_ define step increments (for number type)
* **min** _(optional)_ define a minimum value (for number, date-related, and time-related types)
* **max** _(optional)_ define a maximum value (for number, date-related, and time-related  type)
* **autocapitalize** _(optional)_ enable/disable auto-capitalize on field (defaults to true). if set to "words" it will capitalize the first letter of each word

_Note:_ All of the arguments marked `(blocking)` will block saving if the input is invalid.

_Note:_ On recent mobile browsers, certain input types will have auto-capitalize disabled, e.g. emails.

# textarea

A multi-line text input.

## Arguments

* **required** _(optional)_ set textarea required (will block saving)
* **placeholder** _(optional)_ placeholder that will display in the textarea
